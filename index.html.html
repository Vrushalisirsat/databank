            <p><h2>WEB DEVELOPER</h2><br>
                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.

            <p> <h2>APP DEVELOPER</h2> <br>
                Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such
                as
                personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones.

                These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet
                computer.
                These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web
                applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an
                "application-like"
                experience within a web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of
                screen
                sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and
                changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and
                jobs
                created.

            <P> <h2>FRONT END DEVELOPER</h2><br>
                Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS
                and
                JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
                challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the
                front
                end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
                developing.
                The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the
                information
                in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now
                use a
                large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take
                into
                consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up
                correctly
                in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different
                devices
                (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

                <h2>BACK END DEVELOPER</h2><br>
                Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website
                architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a
                website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end
                developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.
                Most common example of Backend programming is when you are reading an article on the blog. The fonts,
                colors, designs, etc. constitute the frontend of this page. While the content of the article is rendered
                from a server and fetched from a database. This is the backend part of the application.

                <h2>CYBER SECURITY </h2><br>
                Computer security, cybersecurity, or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of
                computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware,
                software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they
                provide.

                The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the continuously expanding reliance on computer
                systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the
                growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute
                the "Internet of things". Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary
                world, due to its complexity, both in terms of political usage and technology.
